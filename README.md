This is a Qiskit program to run 2 decimal numbers and see their results in binary numbers.
A maximum of 5 bit can be used. If you need to add more bits please MAKE the following change in the code:
                    - add more 0s to the array 'r'.
This is only a simulator code, to run on a real Quatum computer minor tweeks has to be made.
