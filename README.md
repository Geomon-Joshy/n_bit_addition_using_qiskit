Python3 along with Qiskit , Qiskit.visualization libraries are prerequired
This is a Qiskit program to run 2 decimal numbers and see their results in binary numbers.
A maximum of 5 bit can be used. If you need to add more bits please MAKE the following change in the code:
                    - add more 0s to the array 'r'.
This is only a simulator code, to run on a real Quatum computer minor tweeks has to be made.
In here we are using the code:
   qc.ccx(q,q+1,q+2)
   qc.cx(q,q+1)  to add two bits, because it uses fewer bits than the traditional sum method in qiskit.
